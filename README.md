# Text Selection Module #

This module allows you to override the browser-level or system-level text highlight color with a color of your choice.

For example, when you select a text on a website to copy and paste it the highlighted text have a default background color and font color. Using this module you will be able to modify this setting to fit the website's visual identity.
